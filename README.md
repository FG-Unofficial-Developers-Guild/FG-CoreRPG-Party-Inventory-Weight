# Party Inventory Weight
This extension adds a weight total to the party inventory and to treasure parcels.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.1.13 (2022-01-05).

It has been tested with the CoreRPG, Pathfinder 1e and D&D 3.5E rulesets.

If you use [Llisandur](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?61628-Llisandur)'s [Party Inventory Identified extension](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?40686-Extension-Party-Inventory-Identified), you will need to use [the version that I posted](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?40686-Extension-Party-Inventory-Identified&p=606935&viewfull=1#post606935) until it gets updated offically.

# Features
The total weight of all items in party inventory and in each parcel is now shown.

A maximum weight field is also shown in the party inventory and, if used, the total weight is color-coded first at 50% and then at 100%.

If you are also using v1.5 or newer of [my Coins Weight extension](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?67228-CoreRPG-Coins-Weight), coins in the party inventory will also have their weight included in the total. If not, only items will have their weight counted.
