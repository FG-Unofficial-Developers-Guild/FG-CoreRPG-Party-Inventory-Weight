The total weight of all items in party inventory will be shown in a new field.

If you are also using [v1.5+](https://github.com/bmos/FG-CoreRPG-Coins-Weight/releases) of [my Coins Weight extension](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?67228-CoreRPG-Coins-Weight), coins in the party inventory will also have their weight added to the total. If not, only items will have their weight counted.
