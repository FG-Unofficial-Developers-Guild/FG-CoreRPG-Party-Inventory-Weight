# CoreRPG Party Inventory Weight
This extension adds a weight total to the party sheet inventory

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.1.4 (2021-06-08).

It has been tested with the CoreRPG, Pathfinder 1e and D&D 3.5E rulesets.

If you use Llisandur's Party Inventory Identified extension, you will need to use [the version that I posted](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?40686-Extension-Party-Inventory-Identified&p=606935&viewfull=1#post606935) until it gets updated offically.

# Features
The total weight of all items in party inventory will be shown in a new field.

If you are also using v1.5+ of [my Coins Weight extension](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?67228-CoreRPG-Coins-Weight), coins in the party inventory will also have their weight added to the total. If not, only items will have their weight counted.
