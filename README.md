# Party Inventory Weight
This extension adds a weight total to the party inventory and to treasure parcels.

# Compatibility and Instructions

It has been tested with the CoreRPG, Pathfinder 1e and D&D 3.5E rulesets.

# Features
The total weight of all items in party inventory and in each parcel is now shown. If currency weight is enabled in options, currency weight will also be included.
